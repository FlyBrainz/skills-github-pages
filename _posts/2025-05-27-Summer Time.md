I finished teaching my Spring course Human Disease Genetics at Lincoln University, and I'm focusing on my research. 
I'll be wrapping up at the University of Pennsylvania in the next two months. Then, my family and I will be heading to Mercer for the upcoming Fall semester. 

I'm looking forward to meeting all of the wonderful students and working with the faculty and staff!
