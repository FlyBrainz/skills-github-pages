## Using the fruit fly to understand sleep physiology
---
##
Sleep is required for all animal life. Complete loss of sleep is not only deadly, but disrupted sleep is associated with significant effects on health. We know from human and animal studies that sleep deprivation is directly related to a decline in cognitive function as well as reduced immune system function. In addition, insufficient sleep in people is associated with increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, as well as many other diseases. Despite this, we still know little about the direct regulators of sleep. The goal of the Deal laboratory is to identify the genetic and molecular players that lead to sleep disruption, with core questsion like:  
- What leads to disrupted sleep, and how does this affect health?
- How can we correct sleep disturbance, and can this improve health outcomes? 
##
To answer these questions, we use the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*.  With their ease of use and extensive genetic toolkit, the fruit fly makes a great model for identifying genes and pathways that may be important for certain biological processes. This has included indentifying many of the genetic pathways important in animal development, identifying the function of genetic risk factors (Pink/Parkin) in parkinson's disease, and identifying the core genetic regulators of circadian rhythms. Fruit flies are great for our system because they have a well-defined sleep pattern and can be readily used for genetic manipulation to understand sleep.

## Are mitochondria a central player in sleep disturbance as we age? 
Aging is defined as a physiological decline in organ and body function, including a decline in healthy sleep. This is particularly concerning since the elderly can already be at risk for health issues that are also effected by sleep. In addition to a decline in sleep, there is also a decline in metabolic function. Many of these metabolic functions are directly linked to mitochondria. Mitochondria are not only key for generating most of the energy in a cell, but they also regulate important signaling components like Calcium and lipids. Recently, we discovered that the gene *PolG1* has a distinct function in sleep. We saw that reducing *PolG1* in the brains support cells, glia, led to aging flies sleeping more and better, but loss of *PolG1* in the brain's neurons led to reduced and disrupted sleep. *PolG1* is a highly conserved mitochondrial polymerase, so it is directly responsible for making for mtDNA. This mtDNA helps build the core components of the electron transport chain, which is used to make ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Our lab is investigating the role of *PolG1* in this process and how its function may differ between neurons and glia.

## What genes and genetic variants may cause human disease and/or alter sleep?  
Mitochondrial diseases are highly heritable diseases that lead to reduced mitochondrial function. With the advent of genome sequencing, more than 300 genes have been identified as mitochondrial disease genes. However, these diseases show a high degree in variability and disease severity and symptoms and are often understudied because their role in mitochondria is conserved and expected. We want to systematically test the effects of many of these genes in sleep to try to identify in certain core mitochondrial functions affect sleep. In addition, we want to test the mitochondrial variants that have been identified in humans. This could not only help identify, which genetic variants may have a consequence, but also may help to explain some of the variability seen in patients.

## Dr. Samantha Deal
Picture? 
Dr. Deal will be joining the faculty at Mercer University in the Fall of 2025. Before that, she worked at the University of Pennsylvania, where she picked up everything she knows and sleep. She receivedher PhD in Developmental Biology from Baylor College of Medicine, where she identified genes that are important for neurological funciton and neurological disease. Outside of the lab, Dr. Deal has a husband, a son, and a cat, and most of her time is spent with them. She also loves to read (mostly epic fantasy books), play video games (mostly Final Fantasy XIV), and do all sorts of outdoorsy activities (mostly camping and running). 
## Interested in joining? 
The lab is just starting out, and we are actively recruiting. If you have interest in joining, please fill out this Google Form.
